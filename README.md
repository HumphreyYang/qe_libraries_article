# QE Libraries Journal Article

Repo for a paper describing the QE libraries

Projects like ours often have an article describing the library, which also provides an academic reference.  See, e.g., https://www.astropy.org/acknowledging.html

It would be good for the QE libraries to have one too, now that they're quite mature.
